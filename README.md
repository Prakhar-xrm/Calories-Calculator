Hello everyone,

Today I’m excited to introduce my project — an intelligent, AI-powered Food and Liquid Calorie Tracker App designed to help users accurately track their daily food and liquid intake in a smarter, more personalized way.

📱 App Overview
The app allows users to enter any type of food or liquid item, whether it's a healthy item like chicken or milk, or a fast food item like burger or pizza.

Once the user enters the food name and quantity, the app uses AI to search real-time data from the internet to estimate the calorie content. Instead of relying on static or limited databases, the app pulls fresh, updated information to give users the most accurate calorie count possible.

🧠 How AI Works in the App
When the user clicks the “Calculate” button, it changes to “AI is Analyzing” — showing that the app is thinking and fetching live data.
The AI searches online to determine the type of food, whether it is solid or liquid, and retrieves its average calories per unit.
If the AI doesn't recognize the food or it's not found, the app doesn't show "Unknown" — instead, it simply displays the food name the user entered, respecting user input without confusion.

🧪 Special Features & Validations
The app has two distinct sections:

Eating Foods (e.g., rice, burger, chicken)
Liquid Foods (e.g., milk, cold drink, water)
To maintain accuracy:

If a user accidentally enters a liquid item in the solid food section, or vice versa, the app shows an error message:
“Wrong Food Type”
If the user enters something that is not edible or drinkable (like "pen", "table", etc.), the app shows a centered error message that disappears automatically in 2 seconds, ensuring a smooth experience without interruption.
